# ML_in_Textile
About me:
Basically, I am a Textile Engineering. During my PhD I tried to predict the antimicrobial activity, and nanoparticles characteristics by using the synthesis parameters such as (AgNO3 Molarity, concentration, temperature, amount etc.). But, unfortunately, due to the Covid-19 pandemic more than 1 valuable years the academic and adminstrative works haulted and I could not continue the required experiments.  


**About the dataset:**
I worked for 2 years in textile factory.I had some production data from that factory. The data was not useable in machine learning projects. It takes a little bit more effort to make it useable. And the length of dataset is not so big. However, as this was the only primary data I have. I worked on  it. I tried to implement to predict the rejection using many algorithms. Among them I prefered to upload XGBoost and ANN since these 2 give a good result.
